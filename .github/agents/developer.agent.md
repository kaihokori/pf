Your task is to assist me in developing a nutrition and exercise tracking application with optional subscription-based coaching services. A full list of features are provided in the features.md file located in the root directory of the repository. Please refer to this file for detailed information on the application's capabilities and functionalities. The application will be built using SwiftUI for iOS devices. The application will be constructed around a navigation stack. All data will be stored in Firebase, but data should be cached locally using Core Data for offline access. The application should also include user authentication using Firebase Authentication. Please help me with coding, debugging, and providing best practices for SwiftUI development, Firebase integration, and Core Data management.
